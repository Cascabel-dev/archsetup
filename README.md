# Arch Setup
Arch Setup is a script that makes post-installation easy on Arch Linux.  It automates the installation of GNOME with Catppuccin theming, as well as common and useful tools and utilities like Alacrity.  
This script is intended to be used on an extremely minimal archinstall-built Arch Linux installation, and places great focus on creating a clean and cohesive desktop experience without installing unnecessary bloat/packages, or requiring any more than the execution of a single run command.
